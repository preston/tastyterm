// This file holds additional node operations we want to run at build time.
// Anything can be done here. In hour case, we use this file to run a
// custom script that teaches Angular CLI how to handle PUG compilation.
// We will also use this file for grabbing OS environment variables and
// automatically updating some of our static config files with those values.


// This step is responsible for modifying the webpack config used by the CLI in /node_modules/
// every time we run 'npm install'. Angular CLI uses webpack under the hood.
// It stores its own webpack config in the /node_modules/ folder, so we can
// utilize the flexibility of webpack config, while keeping the magic of Angular CLI.
// It It's a little hack-y, but it works really well, and allows us to use
// PUG with the magic of Angular CLI.
module.exports.pug = function pug() {
  // Because PUG must be compiled during the webpack process,
  // and because we want to use PUG with Ahead of Time Compiling
  // and live reload dev server, we need to manually put a new rule
  // for PUG compilation into a webpack file for angular cli.
  //
  // Sadly, this is not supported out fo the box with the `.angular-cli.json file`.
  // We must edit another file in node_modules, so in order to not break
  // PUG when we run npm install, we run this file every time the dev
  // runs npm install. This is done using the
  // `postinstall` script in package.json

  // Get stuff for working with the filesystem
  const fs = require('fs');

  // This is the file we will be adding the rule to each time we run npm install
  const commonCliConfig = 'node_modules/@angular/cli/models/webpack-configs/common.js';

  // This is the exact config line it will be adding.
  // EDIT THIS LINE TO CHANGE PUG COMPILE SETTINGS
  const pug_rule = `\n{ test: /.pug$/, loader: [ 'html-loader', 
  { loader: "pug-html-loader", options: { doctype: 'html', pretty: true } } ], },`;

// Open the file
  fs.readFile(commonCliConfig, (err, data) => {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    const configText = data.toString();

    // Makesure the rule exists
    if (configText.indexOf(pug_rule) > -1) {
      return;

    // Let the user know we are running the script to insert the rule.
    // This should show right after the npm install process finishes in console.
    console.log('-- Inserting .pug webpack rule -- ');

    // Actually add the rule to the file
    const position = configText.indexOf('rules: [') + 8;
    const output = [configText.slice(0, position), pug_rule, configText.slice(position)].join('');

    // Save the file
